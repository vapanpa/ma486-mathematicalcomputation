# MA486 - Mathematical Computation
Taken in AY24-1

### Taught by:
COL Kevin Cummiskey

## Description:
This course provides an undergraduate presentation of computational problem solving that builds on math and science classes from USMA. The emphasis of this course is on developing a conceptual understanding of the fundamental topics in algorithm development as well as developing an understanding of a high level programming language. MA486 exposes students to mathematical applications best understood through computational analysis. Contemporary topics of application may include linear algebra, numerical analysis, statistics, data analytics and visualization, simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Students will be exposed to topics in computer science including data structures, object oriented programming, debugging, complexity, as well as testing and verification. We will use a high level computer programming language such as R or Python to explore and expose various topics.
